        I have been waiting. I’ve been waiting all day. Waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me. And it’s you. Who do you know, who’s okay with using children, Jesse? Who do you know… who’s allowed children to be murdered… hmm? Gus! He has, he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn.

And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent and boy he’s got that now. He’s got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him. Come on! Don’t you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he’s wanted.
